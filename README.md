# Rumble

Getting started: you will find a Jupyter notebook [here](https://github.com/ghislainfourny/jsoniq-tutorial/blob/master/JSONiq-tutorial.ipynb). You can use it by installing the all-in-one Data Science platform [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com), unless you prefer to install Python+Spark+PySpark+Jupyter manually (brew, apt...).

## JSON at the scale of Spark

*A JSONiq engine to query large-scale messy JSON-like datasets such as JSON, Parquet, AVRO, CSV, SVM, ROOT or text stored on HDFS, S3, Azure or the local filesystem. Spark under the hood.*
